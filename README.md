# module-1-esp32

project details:
The device is an ESP32 that has a display. A program was written using the Arduino IDE and uploaded from a computer to the ESP32 through a USBC. Once the code was uploaded to the ESP32 the artist ran the code many times to fix bugs and tinker. A 2 pin JST connector can be plugged in to the ESP32 in the back. A battery was soldered to the JST connector and plugged in to the ESP32 to receive power from the battery.

description of project:
Countdown by Beyonce brought to you on an ESP32! The installation 'module #1' is a product of the collective effort of the COMS3930 Art Group.  Each suspended device visualizes a text using a generative program. My ESP32 displays a portion of Beyonce's "Countdown" lyrics.

arduino IDE was used to write this code and specific settings and libraries had to be selected in order to run the code on an ESP32 TTGO T-Display 

problem encoutered: random number generator was used to index a list of colors but was using colors from a previous version of the code. The artist was infuriated and confused by this so she hard coded a color as a last minute attempt to salvage the project.
